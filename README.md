# Spinal cord gray matter segmentation using deep dilated convolutions

[![Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/neuropoly/gmseg/master?filepath=notebooks%2Fchallenge-opensource-model.ipynb)

This repository contains the source-code for the paper "Spinal cord gray matter segmentation using deep dilated convolutions", available as [pre-print on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01269).

*Note: this repository is made for researchers, if you just want to use the method on your data, this method was implemented in the [Spinal Cord Toolbox (SCT)](https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox), where you
can find pre-trained models on large datasets and a user-friendly command-line tool called sct_deepseg_gm.*

This repository contains two notebooks:

* [TensorFlow model](https://github.com/neuropoly/gmseg/blob/master/notebooks/challenge-opensource-model.ipynb)
* [Pytorch model *(experimental)*](https://github.com/neuropoly/gmseg/blob/master/notebooks/challenge-pytorch-opensource-model.ipynb)

You can see the MRI *ex-vivo* [segmentation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Nz6H-wFCsM). Another
manuscript is under review for the MRI *ex-vivo* data.

# Requirements Installation

To use this repository, you'll need to install the following requirements:

* Clone the repository
* Install Python requirements with `pip install -r pip-requirements.txt`
* Open the Jupyter Notebook located at `notebooks` folder

# Remarks
Some remarks regarding the model:

* This model was trained on a common space with a voxel size of 0.25mm x 0.25mm, so 
  you'll have to resample your data to this space if you want good results;
* This repository contains the model trained on the GM Challenge Dataset (both train and validation),
  the model is located on the directory called `models` together with a json file containing
  the mean/std that was used to standardize the training data;
* For the training procedure, please see the original paper for more information;
